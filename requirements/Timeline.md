Prototype submission deadline on **September 21st at 11:59 PM IST**. We hope you are progressing confidently, applying your learnings, and preparing to showcase your best work.


To assist you in this final phase, here is an overview of how your submission will be reviewed by the evaluators:


## How your prototype will be reviewed:

### Step 1: Prototype Deck (PPT) Screening

This is your submission’s entry point and a crucial part of the evaluation.

```Note: Please ensure your prototype deck is detailed and well-structured. If it does not meet the mark, the rest of the submission items won’t get reviewed.  So make it count!```

### Step 2: Prototype Video (3 minutes)

Only if your prototype deck meets the criteria, your demo video submission will be evaluated.

```Note: Without a well explanatory video, further evaluation will stop and won’t get reviewed.```

### Step 3: Working Prototype Link

Only if your video passes the criteria, your prototype link will be reviewed. 

```Note: Your prototype must demonstrate at least 2–3 functional features. Non-functional prototypes will not advance to code evaluation.```

### Step 4: GitHub Repository

Only if all the above submissions pass, evaluators will review your GitHub repository, focusing on technical implementation, coding quality, and Google Cloud AI integration.

```Note: A fully functional product is not mandatory at this stage. We encourage well-structured prototype with a clear execution plan supported by a functional frontend application.```
