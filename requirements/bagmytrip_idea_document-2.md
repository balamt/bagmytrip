- **Timing Challenges**: Lack of insights on optimal travel timing and peak season forecasting
- **Visa Complexity**: Confusing visa requirements and application processes
- **Packing Inefficiency**: Over-packing or missing essential items based on destination/activity
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Inability to adjust plans dynamically based on changing conditions

### Market Gap
No single platform integrates personalized trip planning, predictive analytics, visa assistance, and smart packing recommendations into a seamless experience with one-click booking capabilities.
